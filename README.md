## Introduction

TranslaCall leverages AI-powered real-time translation and voice replication technologies to connect callers across the globe, allowing them to communicate in their native languages via phone calls. The project aims to make global communication accessible to everyone, especially those without smartphones or internet connectivity.

## Features

- **Universal Accessibility**: Works on any phone, anywhereâ€”no apps or internet required.
- **Real-Time Translation**: Provides low-latency, real-time voice translation between multiple languages.
- **Voice Replication**: Preserves the speaker's voice characteristics and emotional intonations.
- **Flexible Payment Options**: Integrates multiple payment methods for purchasing call credits.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle a growing number of users efficiently.
- **Privacy and Security**: Ensures user confidentiality and complies with data protection regulations.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./docs/architecture-diagram.png)

*Placeholder for an architecture diagram illustrating system components and their interactions.*

The system comprises the following components:

- **Call Handling Service**: Manages incoming and outgoing calls using APIs like Twilio.
- **AI Translation Engine**: Utilizes the OpenAI Realtime API for translation and voice synthesis.
- **User Interface**: Interacts with users via voice prompts and SMS messages.
- **Payment Gateway**: Handles transactions for purchasing call credits.
- **Data Storage**: Securely stores call logs, user preferences, and transaction records.
- **Scalability Layer**: Ensures the system can handle increased load using cloud services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Programming Languages**: Python 3.8+
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - Flask or Django for the web server.
  - Twilio API for call and SMS handling.
  - OpenAI API for translation and voice replication.
- **Accounts and API Keys**:
  - Twilio Account SID and Auth Token.
  - OpenAI API Key.
- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data storage.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   <code>
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/translacall.git  
   cd translacall
   </code>

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   <code>
   python3 -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate
   </code>

3. **Install Dependencies**

   <code>
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   </code>

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following:

   <code>
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid  
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token  
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number  
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key  
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   </code>

5. **Run Database Migrations**

   <code>
   # For Django  
   python manage.py migrate

   # For Flask (if using Flask-Migrate)  
   flask db upgrade
   </code>

6. **Start the Server**

   <code>
   # For Django  
   python manage.py runserver

   # For Flask  
   flask run
   </code>

## Usage

- **Initiate a Call**: Users dial the TranslaCall phone number to start a translation session.
- **Interaction Flow**:
  - The system greets the caller and sends a text message for terms of use.
  - Users provide the target phone number and any instructions via voice or text.
  - The system contacts the recipient, introduces the service, and obtains consent.
  - Once both parties are connected, the system facilitates real-time translation.
- **Real-Time Translation**: The AI engine translates conversations with minimal delay.
- **Purchasing Credits**:
  - Users receive notifications as their trial period or credits near completion.
  - Additional credits can be purchased via SMS links, over the phone, or through integrated payment platforms.
